# Explore Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft Edge

In this exercise you will explore some of the ways in which Microsoft Copilot can use generative AI to help you be more productive when creating new content. In the scenario for this exercise, you will start with some high-level notes for a business idea, and use Copilot in Microsoft Edge to help you develop a business plan and a presentation for potential investors.

## Before you start

This exercise requires a free Microsoft account (for example an *outlook.com*, *live.com*. or *hotmail.com* account), and the Microsoft Edge web browser.
